## Umbraco 8

My original portfolio was hosted on Windows Server 2019 with SSL certificate using a SQL database. I had a full templating system and the ability to create new pages etc.

The only reason I switched to a SPA is that I no longer have access/want to use a Windows Environment, as costs were simply too high.
